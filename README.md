# beamly-core.config


## Reasoning

This library is to wrap the [Typesafe config library](https://github.com/typesafehub/config).  Most of the [Beamly] services at the time of writing are Scala based and make extensive use of this and maintaining consistency with them is valuable.


## Releases

* Releases are published to [Clojars]

* Latest stable release is [0.1.0]

## Usage

A simple example:

```clojure

(ns example.application
  (:require [beamly-core.config :as cfg]))

(defn get-my-config-as-a-map [filename]
  (cfg/load-config filename))

```

The config is built up in the following way.

The default config ("reference.conf") is looked for in the class path, over this the provided configuration is overlayed, and upon that the system properties are overlayed.

In this manner default config may be overwritten, but system properties cannot.
